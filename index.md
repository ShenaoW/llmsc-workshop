    <h4><strong>About</strong></h4>
    <p>Welcome to the <strong>1st Workshop on Large Language Model Supply Chain Analysis (LLMSC)</strong>! This workshop brings together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to discuss the challenges and opportunities in understanding, optimizing, and securing the LLM Supply Chain.</p>
    <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era of artificial intelligence (AI), redefining what is possible in domains such as natural language understanding, text generation, and autonomous systems. However, the development and deployment of LLMs are becoming increasingly complex, involving diverse components such as massive datasets, development toolchains, pre-trained foundation models, and specialized deployment environments. This intricate process gives rise to the concept of the <strong>LLM Supply Chain</strong> ‚Äî a dynamic and interconnected ecosystem of stakeholders, dependencies, and infrastructure critical to the lifecycle of LLMs.</p>

The motivation of this workshop is to provide a platform for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to discuss and share their ideas on understanding, optimizing, and securing the LLM Supply Chain. This workshop aims to achieve several goals:

- **Facilitate knowledge exchange** to share ideas and preliminary results on understanding, optimizing, and securing the LLMSC.
- **Identify open challenges and opportunities** to advance future research and practice in the LLMSC.
- **Promote responsible practices** to enhance sustainability, transparency, resilience, and security across the LLMSC ecosystem.
- **Foster collaboration** to bridge gaps between academia, industry, and policy to address the complexities of the LLMSC.
