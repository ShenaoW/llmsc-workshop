Welcome to the **1st Workshop on Large Language Model Supply Chain Analysis (LLMSC)**! This workshop brings together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to discuss the challenges and opportunities in building and managing the infrastructure and supply chains necessary for large-scale AI models. Large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems are transforming industries, but their complexity raises critical questions about **security, governance, and sustainability**. LLMSC aims to address these questions by fostering collaboration, sharing insights, and promoting responsible practices to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

The workshop aims to:

- **Discuss infrastructure challenges** in training and deploying large AI models, including resource management, scalability, and reliability.
- **Explore governance frameworks** to ensure transparency, ethical compliance, and accountability in LM supply chains.
- **Share best practices and lessons learned** from diverse industries and organizations deploying large-scale AI solutions.
- **Foster collaboration** between academia, industry, and regulators to address shared challenges and align on best practices for governance.
