Welcome to the **1st Workshop on Large Language Model Supply Chain Analysis (LLMSC)**! This workshop brings together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to discuss the challenges and opportunities in building and managing the infrastructure and supply chains necessary for LLMs. LLMs and other AI systems are transforming industries, but their complexity raises critical questions about **security, governance, and sustainability**. LLMSC aims to address these questions by fostering collaboration, sharing insights, and promoting responsible practices to navigate this rapidly evolving field.
