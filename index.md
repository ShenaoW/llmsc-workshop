Welcome to the **1st Workshop on Large Model Infrastructure and Supply Chain Governance (LMISC)**! This workshop brings together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to discuss the challenges and opportunities in building and managing the infrastructure and supply chains necessary for large-scale AI models. Large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems are transforming industries, but their complexity raises critical questions about **security, governance, and sustainability**. LMISC aims to address these questions by fostering collaboration, sharing insights, and promoting responsible practices to navigate this rapidly evolving field.
